When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A remote repository could be used if you are using a computer that is not your local computer, e.g. in the library. You 
 could always then pull your new work from GitHub onto your own computer, so that everything is in one place saved in a
 local area, useful for if you do not have any internet access.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatcally stay up-to-date with your 
 remote repository?

If pushes and pulls are done manually, this allows the user more control over the states of his files, especially if
 there are commits that other contributors have submitted onto GitHub.
