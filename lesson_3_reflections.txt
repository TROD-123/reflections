When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A remote repository could be used if you are using a computer that is not your local computer, e.g. in the library. You could
 always then pull your new work from GitHub onto your own computer, so that everything is in one place saved in a local area,
 useful for if you do not have any internet access.
