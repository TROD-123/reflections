When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A remote repository could be used if you are using a computer that is not your local computer, e.g. in the library. You 
 could always then pull your new work from GitHub onto your own computer, so that everything is in one place saved in a
 local area, useful for if you do not have any internet access.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatcally stay up-to-date with your 
 remote repository?

If pushes and pulls are done manually, this allows the user more control over the states of his files, especially if
 there are commits that other contributors have submitted onto GitHub.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are copied repositories from another's directory on GitHub to your own. Unless you have permissions to modify the
 origin file, modifications to your fork leave the origin file unmodified from your end. Forking is useful if you want
 to make some changes on someone else's repository on your own computer through cloning, without having to make any
 changes to the original repo. Forks are only created on the GitHub interface, and become a user's repo which can be
 accessed on a user's local machine.

Clones are copies of a repository from GitHub to a local machine, but can also be copies of a repository made on a 
 local machine. Like forks, clones copy all history and states of the original repo.

Branches occur only on the local level, allowing separate "streams" of commits to be applied on a repository, which
 later can be merged into a master branch.
