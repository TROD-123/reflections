What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initialize a repository in Git Bash using the git init command in the folder in which you want to create a git 
 repository (a hidden folder called .git is created in that folder, containing information about the repository). Run
 git status to see the status of your repository, which presents information about the master, the initial commit, and
 tracked and untracked files.

Creating a repository allows you to use version control for your own files, creating commits and saving and tracking
 different versions of your file. Without this, you can not really use Git for your own programs.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is like your canvas on which you do your work. You get your materials from the artist's palette, that
 is the working directory, and you screenshot your work by committing those changes/work that you've done on your
 canvas, that is the staging area. 
Briefly, the working directory is the directory that contains the files in the repository, and the staging area contains
 the files that you work on whose changes you would put in a single commit. The staging area is an area of liminality;
 it exists between the working directory and the repository and only exists temporarily. The files of the staging area
 enter the staging area through git add, which afterwards gets worked on, and finally leaves the staging area through
 committing the changes done while the files were in the staging area.
