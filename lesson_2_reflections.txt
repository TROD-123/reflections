What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initialize a repository in Git Bash using the git init command in the folder in which you want to create a git 
 repository (a hidden folder called .git is created in that folder, containing information about the repository). Run
 git status to see the status of your repository, which presents information about the master, the initial commit, and
 tracked and untracked files.

Creating a repository allows you to use version control for your own files, creating commits and saving and tracking
 different versions of your file. Without this, you can not really use Git for your own programs.
